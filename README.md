## About Me
I'm a second year at UNC Chapel Hill. I'm very interested in the field of computer science, and particularly it's ever-evolving nature. I'm a big believer in continuous growth and learning and I love how within the field there's limitless opportunities for both. I'm currently particularly interested in full-stack development and am trying to improve my abilities in that regard.

## Skills
Public speaking, Canva, Communication, Problem-solving, Conflict-management, Singing, Cooking

### Classes
I'm currently in MATH381H (Discrete Math), MATH233 (Calculus III), and COMP290 (Special topics in CS). Very fun combination of math classes! 

### Tools and Programming Languages
Python (created a working prototype Snake game). Java (worked on different Data Structures in COMP210). HTML (have created very simple web pages/sites using this). CSS (currently learning more about it).
